# diabetes-eda-project
This is my Diabetes EDA project from Codecademy. I loaded the data, checked for missing values, cleaned it and explored the dataset.
I worked with the Diabetes dataset to explore how different medical measurements relate to the diabetes outcome of patients.

Files included:
diabetes_eda.py – my Python script with all steps of the analysis  
diabetes.csv– the dataset used in the project  

What i did in this project? :
- Loaded the dataset with pandas
- Checked the shape of the data 
- Inspected for missing values
- Used .describe() to view summary statistics
- Found not-realistic values (0 in medical measurements)
- Replaced those 0 values with NaN
- Looked at which rows had missing data
- Checked data types of each column
- Cleaned the "Outcome" column and fixed its type
- Explored value counts and checked min/max values
- Filled missing values using the median

Technologies used:
- Python
- Pandas
- numpy

The goal of this project was to practice:
- data cleaning
- handling missing values 
- basic EDA techniques
